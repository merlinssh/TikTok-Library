Hi all! I am a developer who spends his free time analyzing the algorithms of mobile applications.
After a long study, TikTok is ready to offer the following developments:
  1. Rent your own signature server (X-Ladon, X-Gorgon, X-Khronos, X-Argus).
  2. API of the mobile application implemented in php.
  3. Subscribe to my API. (Using https requests you access my API, then the requests are redirected to the TikTok servers).
  
**For check! You can send a request for the android version to sign by mail and in response you will receive 4 key signature fields.**

## Products
**TikTok Library** is a product that offers developers a set of ready-made features for working with the TikTok application.
